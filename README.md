# FaceCard
For CodeDay2020

This uses a Kinect sensor from the xbox360 to perform facial identification. 
Before running, install Kinect SDK for widows V1.7 as well as all of dependencies imported in verify.py and image_processing.py. make sure to download the python 3 wrapper version of pyknic and not the discontinued one for python 2. 
You can add your own face in the GUI or by dragging and dropping a picture of a pace into the faces folder. Make sure to restart the application after doing so.
